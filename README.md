<h1>EECS3215 Embedded Systems - Lab Project</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
This calculator was built for the Dragon12 Light Board as a part of the <i>Embedded Systems</i> course at Lassonde. It's capable of adding and multiplying digits up to 10000.
Unfortunately, this project was archived a while ago, and uses a modified version of Eclipse with GCC built in, therefore it's not possible to build the file.
