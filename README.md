# EECS3215 Embedded Systems - Lab Project</h1>
### Summary
This calculator was built for the Dragon12 Light Board as a part of the *Embedded Systems* course at YorkU. It's capable of adding and multiplying digits up to 10000.
Unfortunately, this project was archived a while ago, and uses a modified version of Eclipse with the GNU Compiler Collection built in, therefore it's not possible to build the file.
### Demo
See a demo of the original project *(uses the seven segment display to multiply and get single digit numbers)* [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc5MRupQqFM)
